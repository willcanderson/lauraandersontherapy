## My specialities

There are several different schools of therapy: psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, humanistic. I am trained in all of them and tailor my approach individually to each client.

## Your consultation

During your consultation, we'll cover:

- What happens in a therapy session
- How we will monitor improvement together
- When and how often we will meet
- Insurance billing and payment schedule
- What to look for in a therapist, whether or not you decide on me

There is no obligation to continue beyond the first meeting, and if we aren't a good fit I have several colleagues I can recommend.
