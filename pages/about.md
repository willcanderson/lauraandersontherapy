I'm a licensed clinical social worker who has helped adults, children, and families with depression, anxiety, loss, mental illness, violence, family discord, food and substance addictions, and relationship problems.

## Issues

- Depression
- Anxiety
- Grief and loss
- Mental illness
- Violence
- Family discord
- Food and substance addictions
- Relationship problems

## Populations

I'm prepared to help nearly anyone, but there are some populations and issues I have more experience with:
- Individuals who want to work on relationships with family, friends, or professional colleagues
- Individuals who want to work on health issues like weight loss, addiction, or improving body image perception
- Couples who want to work together to improve their relationship
- Teens and young children


## Clinical traditions

There are several different schools of therapy: psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, humanistic. I am trained in all of them and tailor my approach individually to each client.
